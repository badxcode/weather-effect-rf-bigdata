# Weather Effect on RF

This project is mainly focused on Radio Frequency Prediction based on Weather Analysis. Basically, how temparature, humidity and wind speed affects the rf band. 

A small background on the dataset: "The generated dataset contains radio frequency (RF) signal data for a period of one month, from May 5, 2023, to June 11, 2023 collected via SDR hardware interfaced to DragonOS Focal. Each row of the dataset represents a single RF signal observation, with various features that describe the signal and its environment."

## Setup Instructions: 

1. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/badxcode/weather-effect-rf-bigdata.git`
2. Install the required modules: `pip install -r requirement.txt`
3. Download the dataset into the same folder and make sure the file name is `weather_analysis.csv`
4. Run the code: `python weatherEffectOnRF.py`


There are a lot of opportunity to improve the overall project. Have a look if you're interested. Thank you.
